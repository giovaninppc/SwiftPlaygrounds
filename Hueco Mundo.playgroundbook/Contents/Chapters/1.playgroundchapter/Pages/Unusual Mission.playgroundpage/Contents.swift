 Hello!
 
 You are a member of the SEA - Space Exploration Academy.
 Your duty is to follow our most important exploration missions remotely, and provide support to our astronaut explorers.

 The next mission you will be following is called *Hueco Mundo*.
 Our scanners found a strange planet, possibly inhabited, but with a very strange feature - the mass is too low, so probably we are talking about a hollow world.
 
 Our little friend, the astronaut, was invited to a recognizing mission on this planet. Since it's completely new, we don't know what to expect.
 
 You can follow the last images we have on him if you run the current code.
